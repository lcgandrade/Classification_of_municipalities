# About
<p> Let's learn some ways of sorting algorithms from cluster analysis. </p>

# Requirements
<p> I recommend downloading the R cran installer https://cran.r-project.org/ and later the RStudio software https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ to run the scripts below and view the interactions. </p>

# Problem
<p> The client needs to open branches in some cities in the state of São Paulo and would like to understand which are the best cities according to the business strategy </p>

# Solution
<p> Create an algorithm capable of generating groups that are homogeneous among themselves and heterogeneous among groups. </p>

# Method
<p> unhierarchical: The approaches will be used: kMeans . </p>

# Visualization
<p> unhierarchical: cluster kmeans. </p>

# Conclusion
According to the client's strategy, the group of cities should have characteristics with acceptable rates according to the international measurement standard, having as study analysis the variables: birth rate, sewage rate, GDP, population density and formal jobs 2013 It can be seen that group 3 has the best indices to meet business needs, therefore, among the first 4 cities out of a total of 81, the indication according to high GDP indices would be: Campinas, São José dos Campos, Mongi das Cruzes and Piracicaba.
